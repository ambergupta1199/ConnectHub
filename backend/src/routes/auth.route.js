//Why logout is post method?
// Answer: Post is for operations that change the server state and logging out does that. It destroys a session invalids a token. So it basically updates something on the
// server side and that's why we would like to keep this as post.

//protectroute typically used to check if the request is authenticated (e.g. by verifying a JWT, checking session, etc.).
// If authentication passes â†’ it calls next() so the request moves on to onboard.
